                            It was a Monday morning when there was a mysterious
                            flying object outside. The family has 2 parents:
                            Isabella, William. Has two children: Luna and Lucas.
                            It all started when Luna stared out the kitchen
                            window. It was so outstanding, Luna saw a mysterious
                            flying object flying in the sky.
                            <em
                                >“Hey guys, have you seen the mysterious flying
                                object staring out of our kitchen window?”</em
                            >
                            said Luna. “No, that is so weird, last night when I
                            looked out of the kitchen window, there was no
                            mysterious flying object out of our kitchen window,”
                            said Lucas.
                        </h5>
                        <h5
                            class="subtitle is-5 small-text"
                            style="text-indent: 30px"
                        >
                            A few minutes later, Isabella, their mother, told
                            Luna and Lucas to go outside and play. But instead
                            of playing and doing whatever their mother wanted
                            them to do, they wanted to investigate what the
                            mysterious flying object was
                            <em
                                >“Come on, we should really investigate the
                                mysterious object,” said Lucas.</em
                            >
                            “But, mom said we have to play outside, not
                            investigate some mysterious object,”said Luna. “No,
                            mom said we have to go outside and play, which means
                            we can investigate something like a mysterious
                            object,” said Lucas. (By the way, Lucas is 13 and
                            Luna is 6 years old.) “Fine, we can investigate the
                            mysterious object,” said Luna. When they were
                            investigating the mysterious object, they discovered
                            it was a drone that was spying on their family.
                        </h5>
                        <h5
                            class="subtitle is-5 small-text"
                            style="text-indent: 30px"
                        >
                            After a few hours, Isabella asked them to come
                            inside and eat some snacks. Lucas and Luna didn’t
                            want to go inside and eat snacks. They wanted to
                            investigate the mysterious flying object. But their
                            mom insisted they come inside.<em> When they were
                            getting ready for their snack, they were telling
                            their parents about the mysterious flying object
                            that was always spying through their kitchen window.</em>
                            It turns out that the mysterious flying object is
                            basically a drone that has been spying on them since
                            today. After they finished their snack, the family
                            went to the backyard and saw who was making a drone
                            spying on them. And it turns out that the drone
                            belonged to the neighbor next door. The family went
                            to their house. They spoke to the family next door,
                            and they gave the drone back, and it turns out
                            Oliver, the next-door neighbor, was spying on them.
                            They them to never ever do it again and went back to
                            their home to do some work. Finally, they lived
                            happily ever after.
