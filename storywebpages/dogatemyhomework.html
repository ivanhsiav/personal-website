                    “NO!” My dog ate my homework! It all started when my family
                    and I were walking our family dog. We were walking it in the
                    park. After 7:00 we went back to our home. Then I decided to
                    eat a snack. For some reason my dog was so hungry, so
                    instead of asking us to give it some food, it just went into
                    my room and gobbled up my homework. I was eating a snack
                    when that happened. Finally, I went to my room and guess
                    what! I noticed that my dog ate my homework. “Mom! Max(my
                    dog) at my homework!” I said. A few minutes later, my mom
                    came into my room and saw the mess and tiny pieces of
                    homework. “Are you saying that that dog ate your homework?!”
                    she said. I said, “Umm, yes”. I was so sad that I was afraid
                    to go to school. But, my mom said that I am supposed to go
                    to school no matter what. (By the way, I had so much
                    homework). Since my dog ate a lot of paper my mom decided to
                    bring me and my dog to the vet. After a few hours, we went
                    back to our home. I went straight into my bedroom and
                    decided to take a nap. During my nap, my mom decided to give
                    me a surprise. When I woke up to get a snack, I saw it. I
                    saw my homework sitting in front of my dog. It was so weird
                    because my dog didn’t even want to eat the homework anymore.
                    I was sooooo happy. I was wondering “How in the world would
                    a dog print my papers?” So I went to my mom and asked her.
                    She said,” Make sure to do your homework before you go to
                    sleep :)” “Did you print the papers of my homework?” She
                    said that she felt bad that our family dog ate my homework,
                    so she decided to convince my teacher to give me an extra
                    copy. Guess what! My teacher gave me and my mother an extra
                    copy. I was so happy I hugged my mom so much. I finished my
                    homework and went back to sleep.
