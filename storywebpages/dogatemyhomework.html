                                ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù My dog ate my homework! It all started when my
                            family and I were walking our family dog. We were
                            walking it in the park. After 7:00 we went back to
                            our home. Then I decided to eat a snack. For some
                            reason my dog was so hungry, so instead of asking us
                            to give it some food, it just went into my room and
                            gobbled up my homework. I was eating a snack when
                            that happened. <em>Finally, I went to my room and guess
                                what! I noticed that my dog ate my homework. ‚ÄúMom!
                                Max(my dog) at my homework!‚Äù I said.</em>

                        <h4 class="small-text subtitle is-4" 
                            style="text-indent: 30px;"
                        >
                                A few minutes later, my mom came into my room and
                            saw the mess and tiny pieces of homework. <em>‚ÄúAre you
                                saying that that dog ate your homework?!‚Äù she said.</em>
                            I said, ‚ÄúUmm, yes‚Äù. I was so sad that I was afraid
                            to go to school. But, my mom said that I am supposed
                            to go to school no matter what. (By the way, I had
                            so much homework). Since my dog ate a lot of paper
                            my mom decided to bring me and my dog to the vet.

                        <h4 class="small-text subtitle is-4" 
                            style="text-indent: 30px;">
                                After a few hours, we went back to our home. I went
                            straight into my bedroom and decided to take a nap.
                            During my nap, my mom decided to give me a surprise.
                            When I woke up to get a snack, I saw it. I saw my
                            homework sitting in front of my dog. <em>It was so weird
                                because my dog didn‚Äôt even want to eat the homework
                                anymore.</em> I was sooooo happy. I was wondering ‚ÄúHow in
                            the world would a dog print my papers?‚Äù So I went to
                            my mom and asked her. She said,‚Äù Make sure to do
                            your homework before you go to sleep :)‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you
                            print the papers of my homework?‚Äù She said that she
                            felt bad that our family dog ate my homework, so she
                            decided to convince my teacher to give me an extra
                            copy. Guess what! My teacher gave me and my mother
                            an extra copy. I was so happy I hugged my mom so
                            much. I finished my homework and went back to sleep.
