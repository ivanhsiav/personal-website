                            ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù My dog ate my homework! It all started when my
                            family and I were walking our family dog. We were
                            walking it in the park. After 7:00 we went back to
                            our home. Then I decided to eat a snack. For some
                            reason my dog was so hungry, so instead of asking us
                            to give it some food, it just went into my room and
                            gobbled up my homework. I was eating a snack when
                            that happened.

                                >Finally, I went to my room and guess what! I
                                noticed that my dog ate my homework. ‚ÄúMom!
                                Max(my dog) at my homework!‚Äù I said.</em

                        >
                            A few minutes later, my mom came into my room and
                            saw the mess and tiny pieces of homework.

                            >
                            I said, ‚ÄúUmm, yes‚Äù. I was so sad that I was afraid
                            to go to school. But, my mom said that I am supposed
                            to go to school no matter what. (By the way, I had
                            so much homework). Since my dog ate a lot of paper
                            my mom decided to bring me and my dog to the vet.

                        >
                            After a few hours, we went back to our home. I went
                            straight into my bedroom and decided to take a nap.
                            During my nap, my mom decided to give me a surprise.
                            When I woke up to get a snack, I saw it. I saw my
                            homework sitting in front of my dog.

                            >
                            I was sooooo happy. I was wondering ‚ÄúHow in the
                            world would a dog print my papers?‚Äù So I went to my
                            mom and asked her. She said,‚Äù Make sure to do your
                            homework before you go to sleep :)‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you print
                            the papers of my homework?‚Äù She said that she felt
                            bad that our family dog ate my homework, so she
                            decided to convince my teacher to give me an extra
                            copy. Guess what! My teacher gave me and my mother
                            an extra copy. I was so happy I hugged my mom so
                            much. I finished my homework and went back to sleep.
