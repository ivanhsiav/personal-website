I was thrilled to have this opportunity, and my family and friends congratulated me. When I went to the White House, the security guards checked me and gave me a grand welcome. Then, my assistant took me to my office room and showed me a bunch of files to sign. I spent a lot of time reviewing the files. I signed some files that were for student education, farming, and health care, but I vetoed the bills that are increasing the taxes and lay off the employees by business firms and schools if they don&rsquo;t have enough funds. My assistant said,&rdquo; It will be an issue to veto the bills.&rdquo; I was worried about the public having problems if Congress disagreed on the vetoed bills. I wrote a note to congress and mentioned the importance of the bills and how they helped the people in the country.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">After some time, my assistant told me,&rdquo; Mexico&rsquo;s president is going to meet and have lunch with you.&rdquo; I met him with my vice president and team. I am glad that he enjoyed the lunch. After lunch, we were talking about illegal immigrants and border security issues. I assured him I will try to have strong relationships with both countries. But I was worried that Congress would disagree with the illegal immigrants and the border security bills.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A few minutes later, I went to the congress with my vice president and team and told Congress about the illegal immigrants and border security bills. Then my team and I went back to the White House. After we came to the White House, I went to my office to work for some more time. But after some time, my assistant said,&rdquo; Your family is outside of the white house waiting for you.&rdquo; I said hello to my family and gave a salute to the security guards. My family and I went on the plane to go home. When we went home, I told all the experiences I had in the white house for one day. They were very happy that I was president of the United States of America for one day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">The End</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
